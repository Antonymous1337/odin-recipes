    <h2>About Cereal:</h2>
    <p>
        Cereal is one of the most basic things you can make for yourself, so much so that many people don't even consider it cooking to make cereal!
        If you have no idea how to make anything, you got to start somewhere, and cereal is definitely a start. It may not be cooking, but being able
        to make <em>something</em> is a lot better than <em>nothing</em>.
